1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-video-manager.git

2️⃣ Install dependencies

The project uses only Python’s standard library, but installing from requirements.txt keeps things consistent:

pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Run the Application
python main.py

📦 Data Storage

All videos are saved in a JSON-formatted text file:

youtube.txt


Example:

[
  {
    "Name": "Python Crash Course",
    "Time": "12:40"
  }
]

or add this line to ~/.bashrc.
